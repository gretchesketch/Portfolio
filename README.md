Portfolio
homework assignment due: 03/15/2022

This is the beginnings of a landing page for my portfolio. As I grow so will this website.

It contains a skeletal, but functioning nav bar with a hero image underneath it.
The hero image will change at some point. Right now, it’s more of a placeholder.
I have the beginnings of an about me section, work display section, and contact information section.
I plan to add to the about me section as I grow my skill and work through projects. The work display section is full of placeholder images for now, but I will update those images as I create working applications. My contact section is a work in progress; as I practice CSS I’m sure it will take the shape I want.
